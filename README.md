##Simple Yelp

I built Simple Yelp so that I could use Yelp the way I always wanted to. Simple Yelp finds your location and populates the highest rated businesses on the map around you. Three one-click search options are available in the bottom right (restaurants, coffee shops, and bars). If these options aren't enough, a custom search can be triggered by clicking the search icon in the top left. All searches are based on the user's current map bounds.

Simple Yelp uses Ruby on Rails, Nokogiri, JavaScript, Yelp API, Locu API, Google Maps API, and is deployed on Heroku.
